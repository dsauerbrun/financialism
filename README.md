Financialism
============
An abandoned project I worked on with Luke Boris to parse through EDGAR's massive list of 10-K documents. There was about 300 gigabytes of documents to parse through which were not in any standardized format. My initial approach was to use the levenshtein distance algorithm with a little bit of magic to compare financial data labels.
